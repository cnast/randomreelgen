This is a random reel generator written in iPython Notebook.

Requires:
* Music21
* MuseScore

In 2014, I started playing Cape Breton fiddle. 
Not long after, I started playing with iPython Notebook.

Go figure, soon there was a random reel generator.

I haven't really gotten anything playable yet, but it's fun trying.

Check the wiki page for information about the structure of a reel, tones, durations, phrasing, etc.
